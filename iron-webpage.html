        <h2>About The Iron Giant</h2>
        <p>
            The Iron Giant is a sentient mechanical from outer space. 
            His arrival to Earth was troubling to the humans nearby, except for one boy. 
            Hogarth Hughes was welcoming to the Giant and became friends very quickly.
            The Iron Giant was later brutally attacked by the US Military.
